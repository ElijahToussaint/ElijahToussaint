## Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) Engineer

### What is Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)?
Unlike proprietary software, free and open-source software (FOSS) is software that is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change in any way. The source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software. While, proprietary software is under restrictive copyright licensing and source code is usually hidden from the users.

### What do I do?
I focus on designing, maintaining, and contributing to software that is decentralized and federated.

### Where can I contribute?
Help me continue to bring free and open-source software to the world.
